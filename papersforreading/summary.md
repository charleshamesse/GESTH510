# Incomplete Summary of the Readings

# CASE 1: Architect your Business

## Intro

* Architecture is about the “art or practice of designing and building
  structures,” especially buildings.
  
* business architects rarely design their company’s business architecture 
  has become a bad word in some companies, mostly because architects in are 
  seen as more of an obstacle than a problem solver.
  
* with business change accelerating many companies find their processes,
  structures, and systems not agility they need 
  **companies are not “architected” for the digital economy.**

## The State of the Art of Business Architecture

* 2011 < 50% of firms had a business architecture function VS  72% in 2014
    * 58% of 72% in IT
* most common task for business architects = development and analysis of 
  capability maps.
* capability maps can be used with maps of existing applications to identify gaps and overlaps in
  the applications landscape. This help:
    * application portfolio rationalization 
    * establishing priorities for IT investment
*  such efforts are valued mostly within the IT unit.
*  most of the business architects are struggling to gain traction.

## The Growing Need to Architect the Business

* new more complex, integrated strategies due to the digital economy:
    * packaging, integrated solutions that address customer needs instead of selling separate items
    * omnichannel access to the company’s products and services
    * single face to customers : easier to sell across various business lines 
    * rapid innovation (often digital): new products into new markets, new customers. 

* pre-digital companies are not designed to use these strategies
    * the dominant design approach for large companies is “divide and conquer” 
        * individual leaders have responsibility for success of set of closely related business
          activities    
    * These designs facilitate functional and business unit excellence but do not serve integration requirements

* most companies does not now how to integrate increasingly interdependent activities throughout the business.

*  architecture is not a systems challenge, it is an organizational design challenge
    * locating a business architecture function within IT may limit impact 


## What It Means to Architect a Business

* architecture = _the purposeful (re)design of processes, ..., IT systems to 
  create coherence between business purpose and business capabilities._ 
  
* Business leaders now that processes, ... all interact with one another
    
* business purpose = foundation of any company’s design.
    * company’s purpose must be well-articulated, offer a clear vieuw of the 
      value proposition for customers
    * purpose provides direction for design elements.
    * Ex ...

* Philips: three global processes to be standardized: idea to market, market to
order, and order to cash.

* many companies struggle to keep elements aligned (one another and business purpose)
    * out of sync (late to market, to market before customer service, ...)
    * Solutions, deciciding:
        * What set of capabilities constitutes a stable base for ongoing operations
            * designing technology platforms to support core operations,
            * these capabilities ensure quality,reliability of what’s not changing 
              while allowing management to focus on what is changing.
        * What capabilities are most essential to rapid, targeted innovation
            * need capabilities that support targeted business changes.
            * changes touch all elements not just IT, it’s about business architecture.
            * business agility as a goalnot lead to effective design. 
            * Identifying specific activities will add  value by introducing 
              rapid innovation is essential to achieving a company’s purpose.

## What Is the Role of the Business Architect?

* business architects will work with other business leaders to shake up, prioritize, orchestrate, and
design the business—processes, structures, roles, incentives, and systems.
* they will focus on critical gaps, map a plan for addressing those gaps, and negotiate requirements with
leaders who may struggle with all the interdependencies


# Case 2: Demand shaping

* Digital era, to much idea : IT focus more on identifying most important strategic initiatives

* leadership feel not confident that portfolio optimize the opportunity to digitize for both near-term and sustainable

* Demand shaping: ... develop a prioritized list of IT-enabled business capabilities

## The Myth of the IT Steering Commitee

* positive effects of a steering committee on IT portfolio quality is overwhelmed 
  by: 
    * senior executive understanding of IT
    * maturity of demand shaping practices 

* IT portfolio quality related to executive perceptions of financial performance
* IT understanding, demand shaping practices, and IT governance processes
  create a virtuous learning cycle 
    * leads to consistent improvements in the IT portfolio
    * then to improved financial performance

## Changing the Conversation about IT

* Demand shaping practices force constant dialogue between IT and business leaders
* Each practice impacts the conversation in its own unique way ...

## Changing the Conversation at Fidelity Investments Asset Management

* 2008 Crises, fidelity want to do economies but business leaders ask:
    * Why does it take so long to introduce new capabilities?
    * Why are ‘baseline costs’ (maintenance) overtaking new project costs?

* IT leaders start applying demand practices to shape conversation
    * creation of blueprint for shared capabilities with roadmap (introduction of 
      shared infrastructure capabilities and the elimination of redundant)
    * appointed strategic program managers
    * value tracking
    * appointed business advisor leads
    * agile methodologies
    * governance bodies

## Persistent Conversations are Essential

* IT portfolio decision/discussion is perpetuel not annual


# Case 3: Directing difital innovation

* often companies want to be innovative: lots of prototypes/ideas but not much results

* top-performing innovating firms direct their innovation efforts to the areas of
  greatest impact and business priority instead of “letting a thousand flowers bloom”.
  
## PepsiCo—A Digitally Innovative Company

* PepsiCo is digitally innovative because it applies digitization to every
  part of the business, including:
    * Products and Services (wraps digital services around its products, 
      example, PepsiCo’s Touch Tower)
    * Processes (One digital process innovation is an iPad app _Facts on Demand_,
      that shows store sales performance at any time).
    * Customer Experience (interactive social vending machine)
    * Strategy (For example, the company was an official launch partner for iTunes Radio)

## Directing IT Innovation at PepsiCo

* Digital Innovation Center
    * identify points with the highest possible impact on growth

* innovation team identify two to three _sticky business challenges_

* Pepsico has portfolio of initiatives spanning three “Horizons.”
    * Horizon 1 company undestand problem and solution
    * Horizon 2 company undestand problem solution not known
    * Horizon 3 company does not undestand problem

## Flipping the Switch on Innovation  

* instead of innovating in any possible manner, first identify problems where
  inovation could help  
  
## Maximize Your Impact from Digital Innovation

* what highest-priority problems to which innovative solutions could deliver the greatest impact?

* Where should you initially focus innovation efforts across the business—
  strategy, processes, products and services, or customer experience?

* What is your process to lift and scale your successes across the firm? 
  
  
# Case 4: Top performing CIO in Digital era
  
* CIO of all firms recognize the threats of digital disruption
  
* Top CIO differs from bad CIO in:
    * Spend more time with external customers
    * Obsessively focus on innovation
    * Are deeply engaged with their executive committees
    * Open up their systems for internal and external use 

## Recognize the Threat; Take the Lead on Digital  
 
* 49% of the value of top CIO is menaced by digital disruption again 19% for bad CIO  

* Recognizing the threat is keyto survival

* who is primarily responsible for managing digitally enabled threats to the business model?
    * 48%: CIO  (the article also says it should be CIO, or appoint a Chief Digital Officer)
    * 52%: CEO

## Spending More Time with External Customers
  
* 2008: 10% of CIO time for external officer vs 20% in 2015 (top CIO 22%, botom 17%) 
  
## Focusing Obsessively on Innovation

* Innovation = big source of revenue for well performing firms

* top CIO innovation = 53% of their time on VS 19% for bottom CIO

## Working with Their Executive Committees

* executive committees of top-performing firms : 51% of their time on on digitally 
  enabled threats and opportunities against 18 for bottom

* CIOs reported three techniques that are very effective in helping their
  executive committees:
  * digital dashbord identifiying problems and value creation from IT and digital
  * Reporting regularly on cybersecurity
  * very clear and simple IT governance

## Opening Up Systems While controlling more
  
* digital era needs connectivity

* top performing CIOS have : 51% of capabilities available internally and 44%   
  externally VS 27% and 23% for bottom CIOs

## Becoming a Top‐Performing CIO in the Digital Era

* three actions proposed:
    * devote time to these four areas, therefore CIO has to delegate existing 
      responsibilities like running systems and working with vendors to their 
      teams.
    * CIOs must step up to design and implement governance of all digital 
      assets whether or not they are in the IT budget in order to ensure the 
      connectivity needed.
    * lead the company is direction where CIO can have impact such as 
      monetizing data, API creation and reuse, Test and Learn, Agile, 
      or amplifying the customer voice internally 


# Case 5: Succeding at digital requires more infrastructure

* more investment in digital infrastructure is correlated with several desirable
  outcomes, including more revenues from innovation and higher margins.

## Digital Portfolios: Infrastructure vs. Applications

* infra-structure provides the foundation of shared IT and digital services 
  used by multiple applications (e.g., servers, networks, laptops, customer data-
  bases) and excludes applications.
* Applications are all other digital investment that uses the infrastructure.

* from 1993 to 2012, infrastructure investment decreased (54% to 37% of IT investment)
  then from 2012 to 2015 increased again (37% to 48%)
    * companies have recognized a need to become more connected

* top performing companies spent 55% of their budget for infrastructure against
  37 for the others.

## The Key Infrastructure Capabilities

* for service companies, deploying APIs is a strategy critical to improving 
  the customer experience

* adding IP addresses and capabilities to physical assets and products that
  allow a company to create new services and customer experiences.


## What Works Best for Managing and Governing Infrastructure?

* Executive Committee education and focus
* Simple but effective digital governance with consequences (ex dashboard)
* Customer orientation
* Evidence-based decision making


# Case 6: The CIO as venture capitalist

## Approaches of the CIO Venture Capitalist

* three approaches that the CIO Venture Capitalist takes to increase innovation 
  are _Learn_, _Acquire_, and _Partner_
  
* Learn: Invest to Develop Capabilities You Don’t Have but Need

* Acquire: Bring in Revenue Streams or Talent—or Both.
  two types of acquisition:
    * secure new technology or products for the enterprise
    * recruiting strategy to bring in new talent.

* Partner: Build a Portfolio of New Business Experiments

  fund that finds, strategically funds, and works with early-stage tech 
  businesses.
  
* __Orange Partner__  the single publicly accessible source of Orange 
  capabilities and online services for other companies to build on.
